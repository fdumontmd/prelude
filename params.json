{"name":"Emacs Prelude","body":"## Prelude\r\n\r\nEmacs is probably the best text editor in the world. However, the\r\nprocess of coming up with a useful Emacs configuration is long and\r\ndifficult. It's this process that separates you from truly taking\r\nadvantage of Emacs's power. I like to refer to this process as the\r\n**Prelude**. The **Emacs Prelude** has the goal to ease the initial\r\nEmacs setup process and to provide you with a much more powerful and\r\nproductive experience than that you get out of the box. By using **Emacs\r\nPrelude** you're basically getting a \"Get me out of the Prelude, I\r\njust want to use Emacs\" card.\r\n\r\nEmacs Prelude is compatible **ONLY with GNU Emacs 24**. While Emacs 24\r\nis not yet officially released it's a rock solid piece of software\r\nmore than suitable for everyday work. There is no good excuse not to\r\nuse Emacs 24!\r\n\r\n## Fast Forward\r\n\r\nAssuming you're using an Unix-like OS (`*BSD`, `GNU/Linux`, `OS X`, `Solaris`,\r\netc), you already have Emacs 24 installed, as well as `git` & `curl` you\r\ncan skip the whole manual and just type in your favorite shell the\r\nfollowing command:\r\n\r\n`curl -L https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/raw/master/utils/installer.sh | sh`\r\n\r\nYou can now power up your Emacs, sit back and enjoy Prelude,\r\nforgetting about the rest of this manual.\r\n\r\n## Getting Emacs 24\r\n\r\nObviously to use the Emacs Prelude you have to install Emacs 24\r\nfirst. Here's a few tips on doing so:\r\n\r\n### OS X\r\n\r\nObtaining Emacs 24 on OS X is really simple. There are two popular\r\nways to do it. The first is to simply download a pretest (or a nightly\r\nbuild) from [Emacs for OSX](http://emacsformacosx.com). My personal\r\nrecommendation would be to get the latest pretest from\r\n[here](http://emacsformacosx.com/builds).\r\n\r\nThat was really easy, right?\r\n\r\nThe second easy way to obtain Emacs 24 is via\r\n[homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) (keep in mind though that\r\n**snapshot builds are often buggy** to some extend - installing a pretest\r\nis generally a better option). Just type the following\r\nincantation in your shell and you're done:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ brew install emacs --cocoa --use-git-head --HEAD\r\n$ cp -r /usr/local/Cellar/emacs/HEAD/Emacs.app /Applications/\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second step is optional, but it's recommended if you like to start\r\nEmacs from the launchpad or from Spotlight. Personally I prefer to\r\nstart Emacs in daemon mode (`emacs --daemon`), so that I could share a\r\nsingle Emacs instance between several Emacs clients (`emacsclient\r\n-c/t`).\r\n\r\nChances are good you have an older version of Emacs installed by\r\ndefault with OS X. I suggest you to remove that older Emacs version to\r\navoid conflicts with the new one. Do this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ sudo rm /usr/bin/emacs\r\n$ sudo rm -rf /usr/share/emacs\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's all folk! You may now proceed to the configuration section.\r\n\r\n### Linux\r\n\r\nGiven that Linux is more or less the home os of Emacs it presents us\r\nwith the most installation options. Of course, we can build Emacs from\r\n[source](https://github.com/emacsmirror/emacs) on every distribution\r\nout there, but I rarely bother to do so. Using the distribution's\r\npackage manager is a better idea for many reasons - you don't need to\r\ninstall a build chain and lots of dev libraries, you get updated\r\nversions when they are released and you get automated dependency\r\nmanager, just to name a few.\r\n\r\nThat said, few distributions include in their primary repositories\r\nbuilds of Emacs 24. Luckily there are some unofficial repos that come\r\nto the rescue.\r\n\r\nDebian users should look no further than the amazing\r\n[emacs-snapshot APT repo](http://emacs.naquadah.org/). You'll find\r\ninstallation instructions there for all the relevant Debian\r\nversions out there. High quality, highly recommended builds! After\r\nyou've added the repo you can install Emacs 24 with the following\r\ncommand:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot\r\n```\r\n\r\nUbuntu users have easy access to Emacs 24 as well:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:cassou/emacs\r\n$ sudo apt-get install emacs-snapshot\r\n```\r\n\r\nGentoo users have even less to do, since Emacs 24 can be obtained via\r\nthe emacs-vcs package in portage, as noted in the official\r\n[Emacs on Gentoo page](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/lisp/emacs/emacs.xml).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I wasn't able to find prebuilt Emacs 24 packages for any\r\nof the RPM distros (Fedora, SUSE, Mandriva, etc). Since, I'm Debian\r\nuser I have to admit that I didn't look that far, but the source\r\ninstallation is not particularly hard and is always an option.\r\n\r\n### Windows\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to obtain precompiled Emacs 24 binaries if\r\nyou're a Windows users. The most popular are\r\n[EmacsW32](http://ourcomments.org/cgi-bin/emacsw32-dl-latest.pl),\r\n[Emacs for Windows](http://code.google.com/p/emacs-for-windows/) and\r\nof course the official\r\n[Emacs Windows builds](http://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/). I've\r\n,personally, never used any builds other than the official ones. The\r\nunofficial builds usually include installers and various patches that\r\nmight be of use to some users.\r\n\r\nSince I rarely use Windows I cannot give you any more advice on the\r\nchoice of a binary vendor.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n### Automated\r\n\r\nYou can install Emacs via the command line with either `curl` or\r\n`wget`. Naturally `git` is also required.\r\n\r\n#### Via Curl\r\n\r\nIf you're using `curl` type the following command:\r\n\r\n`curl -L https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/raw/master/utils/installer.sh | sh`\r\n\r\n#### Via Wget\r\n\r\nIf you're using `wget` type:\r\n\r\n`wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/raw/master/utils/installer.sh -O - | sh`\r\n\r\n### Manual\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/bbatsov/prelude.git path/to/local/repo\r\n$ ln -s path/to/local/repo ~/.emacs.d\r\n$ cd ~/emacs.d\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'd do well to replace `~/.emacs.d` with the value of\r\n`user-emacs-directory` for your OS. You can check the value by doing\r\n`C-h v user-emacs-directory` inside Emacs.\r\n\r\n## Running\r\n\r\nNothing fancy here. Just start Emacs as usual. Personally I run Emacs\r\nin daemon mode:\r\n\r\n`$ emacs --daemon`\r\n\r\nAfterwards I connect to the server with either a terminal or a GUI\r\nclient like this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ emacsclient -t\r\n$ emacsclient -c\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'd probably do well to put a few aliases in your `.zshrc` (or\r\n`.bashrc`):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nalias e=emacsclient -t\r\nalias ec=emacsclient -c\r\nalias vim=emacsclient -t\r\nalias vi=emacsclient -t\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last two aliases are helpful if you're used to editing files from\r\nthe command line using `vi(m)`.\r\n\r\n## Getting to know Prelude\r\n\r\nCertainly the best way to understand how Prelude enhances the default\r\nEmacs experience is to peruse Prelude's source code (which is\r\nobviously written in Emacs Lisp). If you're intimidated by the source\r\n- do not despair. Prelude includes a `prelude-mode` minor Emacs mode\r\nwhich collects some of the additional functionality added by\r\nPrelude. It also adds an additional keymap that binds many of those\r\nextensions to keybindings.\r\n\r\n## Color Themes\r\n\r\nEmacs 24 ships with a new theming facility that effectively renders\r\nthe old color-theme package obsolete. Emacs 24 provides a dozen of\r\nbuilt-in themes you can use out-of-the-box by invoking the `M-x\r\nload-theme` command.\r\n\r\n[Zenburn](https://github.com/bbatsov/zenburn-emacs) is the default color theme in Prelude, but you can change it\r\nat your discretion. Why Zenburn? I (and lots of hackers around the\r\nworld) find it pretty neat for some reason. Personally I find the\r\ndefault theme pretty tiresome for the eyes, that's why I took that\r\n\"controversial\" decision to replace it. You can, of course, easily go\r\nback to the default (or select another theme entirely).\r\n\r\nTo disable Zenburn just put in your personal config the following\r\nline:\r\n\r\n```elisp\r\n(disable-theme 'zenburn)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can use another theme altogether by adding something like:\r\n\r\n```elisp\r\n(load-theme 'solarized-dark t)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Personalizing\r\n\r\nFork the official Prelude repo and add your own touch to it. You're advised to avoid changing stuff outside of the\r\npersonal folder to avoid having to deal with git merge conflicts in the future.\r\n\r\n## Caveats & Pitfalls\r\n\r\n### Problems with flyspell-mode\r\n\r\nPrelude makes heavy use of the flyspell-mode package for spell\r\nchecking of various things. The proper operation of flyspell depends\r\non the presence of the `aspell` program and an `en` dictionary on your\r\nsystem. You can install `aspell` and the dictionary on OS X with\r\n`homebrew` like this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ brew install aspell --lang=en\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn Linux distros - just use your distro's package manager.\r\n\r\n### Ugly colors in the terminal Emacs version\r\n\r\nIf your Emacs looks considerably uglier in a terminal (compared to the\r\nGUI version) try adding this to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nexport TERM=xterm-256color\r\n```\r\n\r\nSource the `.bashrc` file and start Emacs again.\r\n\r\n### MELPA error on initial startup\r\n\r\nIf you get some http connection error related to the MELPA repo\r\njust do a manual `M-x package-refresh-contents` and restart Emacs\r\nafterwards. \r\n\r\n### No arrow navigation in editor buffers\r\n\r\nThis is not a bug - it's a feature! I firmly believe that the one true\r\nway to use Emacs is by using it the way it was intended to be used (as\r\nfar as navigation is concerned at least). That's why I've disabled all\r\nmovement commands with arrows - to prevent you from being tempted to\r\nuse them.\r\n\r\nIf you'd still like to use the arrow keys just invoke `M-x\r\nprelude-restore-arrow-keys` to enable them for the duration of your\r\ncurrent Emacs session or add `(prelude-restore-arrow-keys)` to your\r\npersonal Emacs customization to enable them permanently.\r\n\r\n### Windows compatibility\r\n\r\nWhile everything in Prelude should work fine in Windows, I test it only\r\nwith Linux & OSX, so there are Windows related problems from time to\r\ntime. This situation will probably improve over time.\r\n\r\n## Share the knowledge\r\n\r\n[WikEmacs](http://wikemacs.org) collects useful resources for working\r\nwith GNU Emacs. Please, take the time to peruse and improve them as\r\nyou accumulate knowledge about Emacs. Prelude makes this especially\r\neasy, since it bundles\r\n[MediaWiki support](http://wikemacs.org/wiki/Mediawiki.el) + the\r\nsettings required to access WikEmacs right away.\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n\r\nCheck out the project's\r\n[issue list](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open)\r\na list of unresolved issues.
